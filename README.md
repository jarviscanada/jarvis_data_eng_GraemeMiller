# Graeme Miller . Jarvis Consulting

My name is Graeme Miller, and I have an academic background in Computer Science, having earned my bachelor's degree from York University. During my time at university, I developed a strong foundation in various aspects of computing, which has been instrumental in my journey as a software developer. I have had the opportunity to take my academic background and apply in a working environment during my internship with Andie, which gave me insight into what it takes to be a Full Stack developer. This experience enhanced my skills in front-end and back-end development and increased my interest in working in the software industry. I am excited to continue learning and developing my skills as a software developer, particularly in building new tools and applications that serve diverse purposes. My dream, and goal is to continue growing as a developer and contribute to innovative projects that make a difference.
